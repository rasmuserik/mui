Long time ago I stumbled on a nice research project at Princeton, which made a word-relation database freely available.  hmmm. couldn't that be used to create a free mobile thesaurus... clickety-click ... a bit of rearranging and the data are suddenly nice thesaurus entries... clickety-click ... whoops, now there is a mobile website :)
