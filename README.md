# Mobile user interface

Unit tests can be run in the browser by opening `spec/testrunner.html`. If more test-files has been added `spec/testrunner.html` can be regenerated by `cd spec; python genhtml.py > testrunner.html`.  To run tests with node, install jasbin with npm, and run: `NODE_PATH=mui jasbin`

## Goal

The goal of this project is to create a cross-platform mobile user interface that runs both as a html5-app(android/iphone/palm/smartphones), j2me-midlet(most other phones), and a wap2-mobile-site.

Applications are written in a subset of JavaScript in order to be able to run on all platforms.
