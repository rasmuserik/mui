# Mobile user interface

The goal of this project is to create a cross-platform mobile user interface that runs both as a html5-app(android/iphone/palm/smartphones), j2me-midlet(most other phones), and a wap2-mobile-site.

Applications are written in a subset of JavaScript in order to be able to run on all platforms.
